The modeling of the world of bees

This project is part of the two annuals project  of the second year at ESIEA in C language.
The aim of this projetc is to model the life cycle of the bees. From the birth to the death.
We also need to implement a an graphic interface where the bees can be shown.

We needed to use the data structure of the the bees and the beehive was create with linked stack and dynamic allocation.

We choose to represent the life cycle and also the lifestyle of bess inside and outside the hive.
We created different type of bees: the guardians, the forager, the drone and obviously the queen.

In this repository, you will find files attached to to back ( construction of the beehive system and life cycle )
And other files linked to the front ( graphic interface )
