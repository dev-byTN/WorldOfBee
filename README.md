The modeling of the world of bees

This project is part of the two annuals projects of the second year at ESIEA in C language.
The aim of this project is to model the life cycle of the bees. From the birth to the death.
We also needed to implement a graphic interface where the bees can be shown.

We needed to use the data structure of the bees, and the beehive was created with linked stack and dynamic allocation.

We chose to represent the life cycle and also the lifestyle of bees inside and outside the hive.
We created different type of bees: guardians, foragers, drones and obviously the queen.

In this repository, you will find files attached to the back. ( construction of the beehive system and life cycle )
And other files related to the front ( graphic interface )
